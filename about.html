<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>

<p>I was born in the beautiful South of France in 1989 and moved to the United States
 just two years later. Since then, I have been living in Rockville, MD. My love for
 computers dates back to when I was in middle school and spent most of my free
 time playing computer games. From the games, I became interested in how computers
 work and how I could modify the gaming experience. My friends and I would
 constantly tinker with the scripts to see what changes we could make to the game.
 Since then, I have always been interested in learning as much as I can about computers.</p>

<p class="margin-top20">This passion for computers guided my decision to choose computer science as my
 field of study. In 2007, I started working at Daly Computers, which gave me a solid
 understanding of computer hardware and software. In March 2014, I got one step closer
 to achieving my career goal by obtaining a degree in Computer and Information Science
 from the University of Maryland University College. Though I no longer find myself
 playing computer games, as I did when I was a kid, I still enjoy tinkering with computers
 and keeping myself up to date in this fast changing world of technology.</p>
